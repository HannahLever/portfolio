            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>In the next few years, I want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Learn more about <mark>digital signal processing</mark>.
                    It's a subject that has fascinated me since I was quite young, 
                    particularly in the domain of audio; How do we use computers to
                    capture, analyze, modify, reproduce, or synthesize signals? DSP is
                    a domain of expertise that not only underlies our modern artistic
                    landscape, from production to distribution to reproduction, but
                    also our telecommunications infrastructure and other areas of
                    our society and economy. Despite my interest, I really only have
                    a cursory understanding of concepts and technologies in the field,
                    so I've got lots to learn and I'm excited to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn about <mark>low-level programming</mark> and <mark>computer
                    architecture</mark>. While I don't necessarily plan on developing
                    any operating systems or designing any CPUs, I do want to deepen 
                    my understanding of the bedrock technologies at play in modern
                    computing, both as a programmer and as a denizen of the digital age.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn about <mark>UI technologies</mark> for both desktop and
                    mobile applications. Most of the programming I've done up to this
                    point has worked exclusively on the command line, but of course
                    that's not exactly the most common way for people to engage with
                    software. I don't plan on specializing in UI/UX or anything, I'm
                    not a particularly visually/spacially-minded person, but I would
                    still like to understand how UI is programmed in modern applications,
                    and the connection between that UI and the underlying computation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get some hands-on <mark>work experience</mark> in software/IT. 
                    I'm looking forward to the challenge of my work placement 
                    (and hopefully co-op as well),
                    it's one of the draws that brought me to NSCC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work on more <mark>independent projects</mark>. The more I learn,
                    the more ideas cross my mind for projects that could be interesting
                    and enriching ways for me to explore programming further and,
                    hopefully, build some useful software.
