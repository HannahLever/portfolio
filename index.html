            <h1>About</h1>
            <p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>
            <p>My name is Hannah.</p>
            <p>
                I'm a first year student in IT Programming at NSCC.
                I've been interested in programming and computer science for as long as
                I can remember, and I started learning my first language (Python) 
                in high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also a musician and a lifelong lover of music, with a keen interest
                in the ways the arts intersect with technology, from the advent of
                musical notation to the rise of the digital audio workstation and
                digital distribution.
            </p>
