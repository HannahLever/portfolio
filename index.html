                <h2>Hi!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Hannah, I'm a first year student in IT Programming at NSCC.
                    I've been interested in programming and computer science for as long as
                    I can remember, and I started learning my first language (Python) 
                    in high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a musician and a lifelong lover of music, with a keen interest
                    in the ways the arts intersect with technology, from the advent of
                    musical notation to the rise of the digital audio workstation and
                    digital distribution.
                </p>
